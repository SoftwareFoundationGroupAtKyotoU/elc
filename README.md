# Elc: A fresh way to verify Rust

![elc-icon](./img/elc-icon.svg)

__Elc__ is a new static program verifier for the Rust programming language,
providing a fresh way.

## Its name, icon and goal

The name Elc is pronounced just as the
[_elk_ (a.k.a. wapiti)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk), a type of deer. The
Rust programming language is known for its cute mascot,
[Ferris the crab](https://rustacean.net/), and the elk with horns may match
nicely with the crab with scissors.

Elc's [icon](./img/elc-icon.svg), shown above, depicts the head of an elk with
fancy horns. Isn't it cool?

The name Elc also stands for *E*rgonomic *l*ogic for *c*oding. Elc
aims to provide a new programmer-friendly way to develop robust, logically
verified programs.

## Current status

Elc is designed and developed by
[Yusuke Matsushita](https://shiatsumat.github.io/), a software scientist working
at Kyoto University, Japan.

Stay tuned for future updates!
